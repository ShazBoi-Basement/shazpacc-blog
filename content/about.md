We are the cult of shaz and we are here to do some programming stuff and random articles and stuff.
We means shaz and pacc cuz no one else will use this prolly...jk jk unless?
We are all dying on the inside everyday but we gotta stay ignorant of that ig?

In a world of normies and degenerates, it is either cringe or
be cringe and we choose to maintain the balance and try to be ourselves at the end of the day.
